## Overview

This is a generated connector for the [OpenAI Chat API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) OpenAPI Specification. OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of a non-profit corporation and a for-profit subsidiary. OpenAI conducts AI research with the declared intention of promoting and developing friendly AI. The OpenAI Chat API provides a way to access the state-of-the-art ChatGPT models developed by OpenAI for a variety of tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before using this connector in your Ballerina application, complete the following:

* Create an [OpenAI account](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
* Obtain an API key by following [these instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication).

## Quick start

To use the OpenAI Chat connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the connector
First, import the `ballerinax/openai.chat` module into the Ballerina project.
```ballerina
import ballerinax/openai.chat;
```

### Step 2: Create a new connector instance
Create and initialize a `chat:Client` with the obtained `apiKey`.
```ballerina
chat:Client chatClient = check new ({
    auth: {
        token: "sk-XXXXXXXXX"
    }
});
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation
1. Now you can use the operations available within the connector. 

Following is an example on creating a conversation with the GPT-3.5 model.
    ```ballerina
    public function main() returns error? {
        chat:CreateChatCompletionRequest req = {
            model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages: [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Ballerina?"}]
        };
        chat:CreateChatCompletionResponse res = check chatClient->/chat/completions.post(req);
    }
    ``` 

Following is an example of using OpenAI vision capabilities when chatting. 

    ```ballerina
    public function main() returns error? {
        chat:CreateChatCompletionResponse response = check chatClient->/chat/completions.post(
            {
                model: "gpt-4-vision-preview",
                messages: [
                    {
                        "role": "system",
                        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
                    },
                    {
                        "role": "user",
                        "content": [
                            {
                                "type": "text",
                                "text": "Describe the image."
                            },
                            {
                                "type": "image_url",
                                "image_url": {
                                    "url": "<image_url>"
                                }
                            }
                        ]

                    }
                ]
            }
        );
        chat:CreateChatCompletionResponse_choices[] choices = response.choices;
        io:println(choices[0].message?.content);
    }
    ```
2. Use `bal run` command to compile and run the Ballerina program.
